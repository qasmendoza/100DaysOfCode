Instructions:

This program takes two inputs. The first input is stored in a variable called a. The second input is stored in a variable called b.

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

Example Input 1
29
41
Example Output 1
a: 41
b: 29
Example Input 2
Hello
World
Example Output 2
